### PowerUpSQL: A PowerShell Toolkit for Attacking SQL Server

The PowerUpSQL module includes functions that support SQL Server discovery, auditing for common weak configurations, and privilege escalation on scale.  It is intended to be used during internal penetration tests and red team engagements. However, PowerUpSQL also includes many functions that could be used by administrators to quickly inventory the SQL Servers in their ADS domain.

For setup instructions, cheat sheets, blogs, function overviews, and common usage information check out the PowerUpSQL wiki: https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL/wiki
